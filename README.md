# LoggerBot for Discord

A [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) bot that logs messages sent to a server including attachments.
It saves it to a 'log.log' file and is available to server admins across the internet.
Anybody who has the link however is able to access the log.



The log format looks like so:

| Channel         | Username      | Message                               |
| --------------- |:-------------:| -------------------------------------:|
| `"general-chat"`  | `"Parton#8122"` | `said "<message>"`                      |
